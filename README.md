a few Java projects completed at CPCC


BlackJack - this game has a JavaFX interface which allows the user to enter even numbered bets up to $100. The game can be restarted by simply entering another bet if the user wishes to keep going or they can exit the game.
The game can be tested by setting READ_DEBUG_DECK in the Deck class. It reads in known card values to simulate particular game outcomes.

NC_RoadMap - This project was an implementation of Java graphs to generate a map and employ various search methods (BFS, DFS, MST). It carries out tasks via a command file and yields information about routes to and from NC cities as well as details on the city itself. Generated output is a text file named NCRoutesOut.
